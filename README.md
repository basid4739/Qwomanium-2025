# Quantum Galton Board using qiskit
Aim: To generate Quantum Galton Board (QGB) in a Quantum circuit using Qiskit.

Let   n = Total number of levels in Quantum Galton Box (QGB)
So, we need ‘n+1’ bins to collect balls. 
## Example
   Consider a 3 level QGB
    n = 3
   Total number of bins = n+1 = 4
